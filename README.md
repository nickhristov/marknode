# About MarkNode

A Java implementation of [CommonMark specification](http://commonmark.org/) forked from [commonmark-java](https://github.com/atlassian/commonmark-java).

Two major changes:

* Replaced Maven with Gradle
* Modified code to add GWT support, which means the same API can be used on both client side and server side.
